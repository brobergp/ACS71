# ACS71
Custom keyboard, OEM PI Pico based.

This rep is not complete, for the moment it contains the kicad schematic and pcb files as the YAML for Ergogen, the body is not finalized but when it is the STL and CAD files will be here as well. And When complete I will add my KMK keymap as well for future reference.
